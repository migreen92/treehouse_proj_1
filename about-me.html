            <h2>Getting Around Town</h2>
            <p>One of the things my parents taught me was to have a love of new places and experiences.</p>
            <p>Having friends in far-flung places has helped spur me to travel further than I ever thought I would at this stage of my life and I'm lucky to have the resources which allow me to hop on a plain.</p>

          <h2>The Last Year</h2>
          <p>The changes brought about by Covid have given me a number of new opportunities that I would never have been able to experience otherwise.</p>
          <p>I never had the ability to work remote at the beginning of 2020 and that needed to change once Boston shut down. What was initially "see you in three weeks" slowly got pushed further and further. When all is said and done, the next time I work from the office will be a year and a half later.</p>

          <h2>A New Home</h2>
          <p>Once venturing beyond the apartment was no longer a fearful enterprise, our new normal began to take form.</p>
          <p>A small group of friends and I relocated to Park City, Utah, for weeks at a time thanks to our friends' parents letting us take short-term residence at their second home. With vacation to use or lose and a workday ending at 3pm, four hour roadtrips for three-day weekends became the new norm.</p>

          <h2>One Park, Two Park, Three Park, Four</h2>
          <p>In June of 2020, I had only been to one National Park. A year later, I've been to ten parks across five states.</p>
          <p>I've hiked more in the last year than ever before. I've spent less time in front of screens. I was able to see the Milky Way without having to board a plane. I jummped in glacial lakes, climbed through slot canyons, trekked through rivers, summited mountains, and walked through waterfalls spray. None of this would have been possible without Covid.</p>
